NOTES

    11.26.22CV - Game is now starting to become more game like. Logic to tie together
    buildings and population gives a feeling of strategy. Need to tie together 
    residential buildings as well. At some point will need to tie in other cTy's in
    the region though some other concept dev work needs to take place first. Like
    the ability to save/load cTy's. Thinking default save location to be user's pwsh
    module directory. Should also think about save structure, need to consider pwsh
    base install conditions, no sql or such like. I'll probably just encrypt JSON
    in some generic way and leave it at that.
        Deleting cTy's also presents some interesting conditions. Requires reindex
    of region array. I could bypass this with some creative thinking to track last
    used cTy and default to that, but I like the challenge.
        Hopefully game will actually be fun to play in the future, ha!
