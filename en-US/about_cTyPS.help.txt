SHORT DESCRIPTION
    cTyPS is a prototype text based city builder game written entirely in pwsh (Powershell).

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Originating from a natural love of strategy and city builder games this project is used
    to test the limits of pwsh (not Windows Powershell).  Shortcuts such as using C# code
    to overcome pwsh's limitations are not permitted.
